    "    In this lab, I worked to uncover and analyze data from the City of Seattle surrounding wages by hour for those who work for the city. While sorting this data, I looked for a few specific details and formed a few questions. Which city employee has the largest income? Who has the smallest? What is the average hourly wage for a Seattle city employee? Through sorting and analyzing this data, I found figures for the maxiumum, minimum, and average data as well as who makes the most and least in our city."

    "Overall, we found that there is a huge range of salary of the 12934 employees that work for the City of Seattle. The maximum figure or 137.788 an hour is much bigger than the mean at 39.59 an hour. Even under that is the minimum rate, a salary that cuts below minimum wage, at 5.53 an hour. For me, this raises the question of why this salary is below minimum wage? How is this legal? Could the data not account for something here? Additionally, why is the maximum salary so significantly above the mean income? Why is this figure an outlier? While sorting through this data, a lot of these questions were left unanswered. Do all of these employees work full time? When do they recieve raises? Overall, I learned alot through sorting these figures about the wages in our City, and was amazed by how many people work for our city under different occupations."
